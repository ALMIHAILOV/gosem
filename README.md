An implementation of DLMS/COSEM en/decoder in Golang

This is a project for myself while learning Golang.
My goal is to create an encoder/decoder for DLMS/COSEM standard. I have done it in python but only for data transfer services. ACSE will be made if i have the chance to learn, and test.

For now there are 2 packages in this project: axdr and dlms
