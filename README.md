An implementation of DLMS/COSEM en/decoder in Golang

This is a project for myself while learning Golang.
My goal is to create an encoder/decoder for DLMS/COSEM standard. I have done it in python for my company but only for data transfer services. Therefore ACSE part will be the last one, and only after I tested it with real meter device.

For now there are 2 packages in this project: axdr and cosem
